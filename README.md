# Effectra Framework Core

Effectra is an MVC (Model-View-Controller) framework designed to provide a structured and organized approach to web application development. It follows a directory structure similar to Laravel and offers various features and components to build robust web applications.

## Classes and Components

Effectra provides various classes and components to facilitate development. Here are some of the main classes:

- **Application**: The `Application` class serves as the entry point for the Effectra framework. It handles the initialization of the framework, routing, middleware handling, and request/response management.
- **AppCore**: The `AppCore` class represents the core of the application and contains the configuration, middleware definitions, and other application-specific settings.
- **Console**: The `AppConsole` class handles console commands and provides a command-line interface for running tasks and scripts.
- **AppRoute**: The `AppRoute` class extends the `Route` class and adds additional functionality specific to the Effectra framework.

These are just some of the classes and components available in the Effectra framework. Refer to the documentation for a more comprehensive list and detailed usage instructions.

## Getting Started

To get started with Effectra, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Effectra repository or install it via Composer.
2. Configure the application settings in the `config` directory, including the database and environment settings.
3. Define routes in the `routes` directory to map URLs to controllers and actions.
4. Create controllers and models in the `app` directory to handle application logic and interact with the database.
5. Create views in the `views/` directory to define the presentation layer of your application.
6. Run the application using the built-in server or configure a web server to serve the `public` directory as the web root.
7. Test your application and iterate on the development process.
